# HTML Assessment

### Description
This is a basic mockup that was followed from an example. The main goal of this project was to put together an HTML webpage that looked just the example that was provided.


### Technologies Used
- Atom
- Git
- HTML

### What I learned
This is not my first time using HTML, I am pretty familiar with it. But I have never really needed to use a table for the projects I was working on. This project taught me how to make a table in html with a caption and table headers for titling. This also got some extra work in using several variations of form inputs and creating labels for the inputs.
